# DIBBS
 Dynamically Improved Bounds Bidirectional Search (DIBBS) is a front-to-front bidirectional search based on A*.
 
 This repo contains a simple implimentation of the algorithm using c++.

 TestCases folder contains some sample maps that are used to test the algorithms. They are generated by https://codepen.io/anon/pen/squgF (A Pen by Captain Anonymous)

### There are three source code files:
 - #### AStarImpl.cpp
    
    This is an implimentation of the original astar search. It is implimented for the purpose of comparison between astar and dibbs.

 - #### DibbsMain.cpp
    
    This is an implimentation of the dibbs based on the pseudo code of the DIBBS paper by Dr. Sewell and Dr. Jacobson. 

 - #### DibbsThread.cpp

    This is an implimentation of the dibbs that uses two threads to run the algorithm to achieve real bidirection search.

### Instructions

The standard compiler for this project is g++. 
#### Build commands
 - ##### AStarImpl.cpp
    ``` 
    >> g++ AStarImpl.cpp -o astar
    ```
 - ##### DibbsMain.cpp
    ``` 
    >> g++ DibbsMain.cpp -o dibbsm
    ```
 - ##### DibbsThread.cpp
    ``` 
    >> g++ DibbsMain.cpp -o dibbst -lpthread 
    ```
#### Run command
```
>> executable [inputmap] [resultout]
```

### Other comments
For futher development of this code such as large grid maze testing, the 2D matrices used to store map data can be replaced using vectors to avoid memory limitations.

This work is a part of the SIUE Math Department Senior Project.
